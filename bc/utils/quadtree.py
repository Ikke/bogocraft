    """An implementation of a quad-tree.
 
    This QuadTree started life as a version of [1] but found a life of its own
    when I realised it wasn't doing what I needed. It is intended for static
    geometry, ie, items such as the landscape that don't move.
 
    This implementation inserts items at the current level if they overlap all
    4 sub-quadrants, otherwise it inserts them recursively into the one or two
    sub-quadrants that they overlap.
 
    Items being stored in the tree must be a pygame.Rect or have have a
    .rect (pygame.Rect) attribute that is a pygame.Rect
	    ...and they must be hashable.
